# Nordic Wallpapers
A collection of wallpapers cherry picked from [reddit](https://reddit.com/r/ImageGoNord), [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/t/wallpapers),
[Christian Chiarulli's discord server](https://discord.gg/Xb9B4Ny), [wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc) and
[ThePrimeagen's wallpaper repository](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/anime).
Most of 'em "norded" through
[ImageGoNord](https://ign.schrodinger-hat.it "ImageGoNord") website from
[SchrÃ¶dinger-Hat](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat).

Previews of the wallpapers can be seen in [here](/wallpaper-preview.md).

## Here is an example

and [this](wallpapers/ign_unsplash4.png) is the result after being processed by ImageGoNord.

## Made with ImageGoNord
I found this project [ImageGoNord](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat/ImageGoNord) and I absolutely loved it. I started making all the wallpapers I liked to match my WM's colorscheme. I then thought I should make this a collection for others to use too since there are many ricing enthusiasts around the world. This could not have been possible without the [ImageGoNord](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat/ImageGoNord) project by [SchrÃ¶dinger Hat](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat).

This repo is not inactive. I ran out of wallpapers and waiting for pull requests until I find new wallpapersðŸ˜¬
